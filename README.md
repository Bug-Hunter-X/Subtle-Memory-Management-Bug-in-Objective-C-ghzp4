# Objective-C Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common and subtle bug in Objective-C related to memory management and object ownership.  The bug involves incorrect handling of object lifecycles, potentially leading to crashes due to dangling pointers or memory leaks due to unreleased objects.

The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version with explanations.

## Bug Description

The core issue is improper handling of object ownership in `MyClass`. Incorrect use of `retain`/`release` (or ARC) results in unintended object deallocation and can lead to crashes when attempting to access deallocated objects.

## Solution

The solution involves understanding object ownership and adopting best practices.  In the corrected code (`bugSolution.m`), the necessary changes are made to ensure proper object lifecycle management.
